# 🚀 Ravish Sikha – Product + Tech Portfolio (90-Day Build Plan)

Welcome to my product portfolio – a live, full-stack journey blending product leadership, engineering execution, and ML experimentation over 90 days (July–Sept 2025).

This repo showcases my commitment to continuous learning, shipping fast, and building with both **PM depth** and **technical fluency** – the skillset demanded by top-tier tech companies like Stripe, Google, Uber, and Coinbase.

---

## 📌 Project Goals

- Build 2+ full-stack product experiences using:
  - React (Vite), Python (Flask), PostgreSQL, Streamlit
  - CI/CD, Docker, AWS for deployment
- Embed ML models into product flows (chatbots, predictions, metrics)
- Develop custom dashboards to track real-time build progress
- Publish weekly PM reflections and case briefs via Substack

## 🧠 Learning Themes

Each project is designed to reflect a core pillar of modern product leadership:

| Theme | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| 🔍 Product Sense | MVP design, problem framing, storytelling |
| 📈 Product Analytics | KPIs, growth loops, dashboarding |
| ⚙️ Full-Stack Execution | React + Python APIs, databases, infra |
| 🧪 ML Integration | Model APIs, intelligent features |
| 🧭 Strategy + Leadership | Roadmaps, tradeoffs, influence docs |

# üöÄ Ravish Sikha ‚Äì Product + Tech Portfolio (90-Day Build Plan)

Welcome to my product portfolio ‚Äì a live, full-stack journey blending product leadership, engineering execution, and ML experimentation over 90 days (July‚ÄìSept 2025).

This repo showcases my commitment to continuous learning, shipping fast, and building with both **PM depth** and **technical fluency** ‚Äì the skillset demanded by top-tier tech companies like Stripe, Google, Uber, and Coinbase.
